## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user invokes `$graphify` or explicitly asks to use Graphify, load the `graphify` skill before doing anything else.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After each coherent batch of code changes, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost), and include meaningful graph updates with the corresponding commit.
- Track the current `graphify-out/graph.json`, `GRAPH_REPORT.md`, shared labels, and portable `manifest.json`; track the wiki only if intentionally maintained. Keep caches, machine-specific files, temporary extraction files, `.vocab.txt`, `graph.html`, and dated snapshots ignored and untracked. Git history preserves older graph versions.
